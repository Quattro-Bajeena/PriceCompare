A high number of Internet shops makes it difficult for a customer to review manually all the available offers and select
optimal outlets for shopping. A partial solution to the problem is brought by price comparators which produce price rankings
from collected offers. However, theirpossibilities are limited to a comparison of offers for a single product requested by
the customer. The issue we investigate in this paper is a multiple-item multiple-shop optimization problem, in which total
expenses of a customer to buy a given set of items should be minimized over all available offers. In this paper, the Internet
Shopping Optimization Problem (ISOP) is defined in a formal way and a proof of its strong NP-hardness is provided. We
also describe polynomial time algorithms for special cases of the problem.

# 1. Introduction

On-line shopping is one of key business activities offered
over the Internet. A survey concerning American Inter-
net users behavior published by Pew Internet & Ameri-
can Life Project in February 2008 (Horrigan, 2008) shows
that the population of on-line customers grows rapidly and
systematically from year to year. The number of on-line
users either buying or searching for products on-line since
2000 has roughly doubled. While in 2000 22% of Ame-
ricans (46% of on-line users) had some experience with
buying products in virtual shops, the ratio grew to 39%
in 2003 and reached 49% (66% of on-line users) in 2007.
The development of on-line shopping is also stimulated by
the increasing number of Internet users. E-commerce re-
venue has grown from $7.4 billion in the middle of 2000 to
$34.7 billion in the third quarter of 2007. A survey concer-
ning the behavior of customers in Poland (Gemius, 2008)
confirms the tendency observed in America. Among va-
rious business instruments commonly available on-line

since 1990s, like auctions (Lee, 1998; Klein, 2000) and
(Vulkan, 2003, pp. 149-178), banking and secure pay-
ment (Langdon et al ., 2000), shopping (Liang and Hu-
ang, 1998), electronic libraries (Lesk, 1997), etc., on-line
retail remains the service offered by the highest number of
providers. A growing number of on-line shops and incre-
ased accessibility to customers world-wide due to the use
of credit card payment in on-line transactions (Langdon
et al ., 2000) are key attributes that force strong compe-
tition on the market, keep prices low (when compared to
off-line shopping) and make more and more customers in-
terested in on-line purchasing (Vulkan, 2003, pp. 22-27).
However, a wide choice of on-line shops makes it diffi-
cult to manually compare all the offers and choose optimal
providers for the required set of products.
A solution of this problem has been supported by
software agents (Tolle and Chen, 2000), so-called pri-
ce comparison sites. The concept of a price compara-
tor is built on the idea of collecting offers of many
on-line shops and building a price ranking on a custo-

mer’s request. This approach is commonly accepted by
customers and, according to Alexa Rank, popular price
comparison services belong to the group of 1000 most
viewed sites world-wide:shopping.com: 518-th pla-
ce,nextag.com: 533-th place,bizrate.com: 600-
th place,shoplocal.com: 932-th place (site popularity
results registered in October 2008,www.alexa.com).
It is worth noting that price ranking built on-line on a
customer’s request expressed in a text query (product de-
scription) is a solution to a specific case of shopping, in
which a customer wants to buy a single product. Multi-
ple item shopping is not supported by price comparators
available nowadays. Furthermore, price comparison sites,
being commercial projects, tend to optimize their incomes
from directing customers to particular on-line shops. As a
result, price comparison sites play the role of recommen-
der systems (Satzger _et al_ ., 2006) which tend to detect a
customer’s preferences and interests in order to suggest
products to buy. A side effect of the problems mentioned
above is the loss of customer confidence. To illustrate the
optimization process, we would like to consider and assess
its benefits. To this end, let us consider an example below.
A customer wants to buy five books. The prices of the bo-
oks and delivery costs in six shops which the customer
considers as potential shopping locations are collected in
Ta b l e 1.
The customer’s goal is to buy all five books at mini-
mum expense. The support from currently available price
comparators allows building the customer’s basket based
on optimal offers for each individual book. The result of
the selection process is presented in Table 2.
The shopping performed upon price comparator sug-
gestions would not be optimal (total cost: 210) because
simple price comparison does not include delivery cost,
which grows as the number of shopping locations grows.
In order to find the cheapest solution for the ISOP illu-
strated above, one can perform a complete search of all
possible realizations of shopping. The simple example we
analyze shows that the optimization process may bring so-
me savings. In our example, the optimal cost of purcha-
se (in Shop 1 and Shop 4) equals 189 (see Table 3). The
problem addressed in this paper is to manage a multiple-
item shopping list over several shopping locations. The
objective is to have all the shopping done at minimum to-
tal expense. One should notice that dividing the original
shopping list into several sub-lists whose items will be
delivered by different providers increases delivery costs.
These are counted and paid individually for each package
(sub-list) assigned to a specific Internet shop in the opti-
mization process.
In the sequel, we consider the above mentioned Inter-
net shopping optimization problem in a more formal way.
In Section 2, a formal definition of the problem is given.
In Section 3, we prove that the ISOP is NP-hard in the
strong sense and that it is not approximable in polynomial

time. In Section 4, we demonstrate that the ISOP is po-
lynomially solvable if the number of products to buy,n,
or the number of shops,m, is a given constant. The paper
concludes with a summary of the results and suggestions
for future research.
```
# 2. Problem definition

```
The notation used throughout this paper is given in Ta-
ble 4. We study the following problem of Internet shop-
ping. A single buyer looks for a multiset of products
N ={ 1 ,...,n}to buy inmshops. A multiset of ava-
ilable productsNl,acostcjlof each productj ∈Nl,
and a delivery costdlof any subset of the products from
the shop to the buyer are associated with each shopl,
l=1,...,m. It is assumed thatcjl =∞ifj ∈Nl.
The problem is to find a sequence of disjoint selections
(or carts) of productsX =(X 1 ,...,Xm),whichwe
call a cart sequence , such thatXl⊆Nl,l=1,...,m,
∪ml=1Xl=N, and the total product and delivery cost, de-
noted byF(X):=
```
```
∑m
l=

## )

```
,is
minimized. Here|Xl|denotes the cardinality of the mul-
tisetXl,andδ(x)=0ifx=0andδ(x)=1ifx> 0.
We denote this problem as the ISOP, its optimal solution
asX∗, and its optimal solution value asF∗.
```
# 3. Strong NP-hardness and

# inapproximability

```
In this section we will analyze the computational com-
plexity of the ISOP. We will demonstrate its strong NP-
hardness by proving strong NP-completeness of its deci-
sion counterpart—Problem P1. The latter has the same in-
put as the ISOP plus an additional parametery,andthe
question is to determine whether there exists a selection
of products with the total costF(X)≤y.
```
```
Theorem 1. The ISOP is NP-hard in the strong sense even
if all costs of the available products are equal to zero and
all the delivery costs are equal to one.
```
```
Proof. We construct a pseudo-polynomial transformation
of Problem P1 from the strongly NP-complete problem
EXACTCOVER BY3-SETS(X3C), see (Garey and John-
son, 1979).
```
```
EXACTCOVER BY3-SETS(X3C) can be defined
as follows: Given a familyE={E 1 ,...,EL}of three-
element subsets of the setK={ 1 ,..., 3 k},doesEcon-
tain an exact cover ofK,i.e., a subfamilyY⊆Esuch that
eachj∈Kbelongs to exactly one three-element set inY?
It is clear that ifYis a solution to X3C, then|Y|=k.
Given an instance of X3C, we construct the following
instance of Problem P1. There arem=Lshops with
available products of the setsNl=El,l=1,...,L.The

buyer would like to purchase the set of productsN=K.
The cost of any product available in any shop is equal to
zero (cjl=0,j∈Nl,l=1,...,m), the delivery cost
from any shop to the buyer is equal to one (dl=1,l=
1 ,...,m), and the threshold value of the criteria isy=k.
We show that X3C has a solution if and only if there exists
a solutionXfor the constructed instance of Problem P
withF(X)≤k. It is easy to see that our transformation
is polynomial and pseudo-polynomial at the same time.
Therefore, Problem P1 belongs to the class NP.
LetYbe a solution to X3C. Construct a solution to
Problem P1, in which the required products are purchased
inkshops determined by their sets of productsNl=El∈
Y, i.e.,Xl=NlifNl∈YandXl=∅ifNl∈Y.Since
Y is an exact cover ofK, all the required products are
purchased, and the cost of the corresponding solution is
F(X)=k.
Now assume that there exists a solutionXto Pro-
blem P1 with the cost valueF(X)≤k. On the one hand,
for this solution the number of shops withXl=φshould
not exceedkbecause otherwiseF(X)>k. On the other
hand, the number of these shops should not be less than
kbecause otherwise at least one productj∈Nwill not
be purchased. Therefore, there are exactlykshops with
Xl=∅. Since the purchased products form the setK,the
collection of the shops withXl=∅represents a solution
to X3C. 
We now discuss the approximability of the ISOP. Let
us consider its special case, in which the cost of any pro-
duct in any shop is equal to zero, and the delivery cost
from any shop to the buyer is equal to one. This special
case is equivalent to the following MINIMUMSETCO-
VERproblem, see (Crescenzi and Kann, 2008).

```
MINIMUMSETCOVER: Given a collectionCof subsets
of a finite setS, find a set cover forS, i.e., a subsetC′⊆
Csuch that every element inSbelongs to at least one
member ofC′, which minimizes the cardinality of the set
cover, i.e.,|C′|.
Due to (Raz and Safra, 1997), the problem MINI-
MUMSETCOVERis polynomially non-approximable wi-
thin the ratioc·ln|S|, for some constantc> 0. Therefore,
the following statement can be formed.
```
```
Statement 1. There exists no polynomial (c·lnn) -
approximation algorithm for the ISOP, unless P=NP.
```
# 4. Polynomial algorithms for special cases

```
Notice that the intractability of the ISOP is established un-
der the assumption that both the number of products to
buy,n, and the number of shops,m, are variables. In this
section we present two solution approaches for the ISOP,
which are polynomial if eithernormis a constant.
The idea of our first algorithm SHOP-ENUM is to
enumerate all possible selections of shops containing all
the required products, to choose the best cart sequence
X(M)for each selection of shopsM,M⊆{ 1 ,...,m},
to calculate the total product and delivery cost for eachM,
and, finally, to find a cart sequenceX∗with the minimum
total cost,F∗.
```
```
Algorithm SHOP-ENUM
```
```
Step 1. SetF∗=∞andXl∗=∅,l=1,...,m.
Step 2. Consider selections of shops to buy all the requ-
ired products. Each shopl,l ∈{ 1 ,...,m}, such that

Nlis non-empty can be selected or not; therefore, the-
re are at most 2 mselections. For each selection of shops
Mperform the following computations. IfMdoes not
contain all the required products, then skip considering
this selection. Otherwise, do the following: Determine a

cart sequenceX(M)=(X( 1 M),...,Xm(M)),Xl(M)⊆Nl,
l=1,...,m, as follows. For each producti∈N,se-
lect a shopl∈Min which the cost of productiis lo-
west. This can be done in constant time if costscilare
stored for each productiin a heap. Assign productito
the corresponding multisetX(lM).Notice that the assign-
ment strategy can eliminate some of the selected shops.
This strategy is optimal for a given selection of shops due
to the fact that the total product costs are minimized and
the total delivery cost does not exceed the sum of deli-
very costs for the selected shops. Calculate the total cost,
F(X(M)).IfF(X(M))<F∗,re-setF∗:=F(X(M))
andX∗:=X(M).

_Step 3._ Output optimal solutionX∗with the minimum
costF∗.
The time complexity of the SHOP-ENUM algorithm
isO(n 2 m), which is polynomial (linear) if the number of
shopsmis a constant.
The idea of our second algorithm, PRODUCT-
ENUM, is to enumerate all possible shop choices for each
product. LetS=(S 1 ,...,Sn)be a shop sequence such
thatSi∈{ 1 ,...,m}is a shop in which productiwill
be purchased,i=1,...,n. The algorithm determines a
shop sequenceS∗with the minimum total cost,F∗,ofthe
corresponding cart sequence.

```
Algorithm PRODUCT-ENUM
```
_Step 1._ SetF∗=∞andS∗i=∅,i=1,...,n.

_Step 2._ Consider shop sequencesS=(S 1 ,...,Sn)such
that producti∈Nwill be purchased in shopSi,i=
1 ,...,n. There are at mostmnsuch sequences. For each
sequenceS, calculate the cost of the corresponding cart

```
sequence,F(S).IfF(S)<F∗,re-setF∗=F(S),S∗:=
Sand pass on to considering the next shop sequence.
```
```
Step 3. Output optimal shop sequenceS∗with the mini-
mum total costF∗.
```
```
The time complexity of the algorithm PRODUCT-
ENUM isO(nmn), which is polynomial if the number
of productsnis a constant.
The algorithm PRODUCT-ENUM can be applied in
practice if the number of products to buy,n,issmalland
the number of shops having these products,m,islarge.
Alternatively, if the number of shopsmis small and the
number of the required productsnis large, the algorithm
SHOP-ENUM can be efficient.
```
# 5. Conclusions

```
Internet shopping is often attributed with prices lower
than in traditional shops. Another strong advantage of an
on-line purchase is a wide choice of alternative retailers
which, in general, remain at the same distance from the
customer—at least one day for shopping delivery. Posta-
ge cost is often non-zero, which makes it reasonable to
group purchased products so that each group is ordered in
the same shop, and the total purchase and delivery cost is
minimized. Changing retail location for the same product
can be possible, provided that the customer is guarante-
ed that the product in a new location is identical to that
in an old one. In the case of changing the retail location,
the quantity and quality of the product must be identical.
However, the total price can change because of different
times of delivery, different profit margins, etc. Customers
are interested in minimizing the total product and delive-
ry cost. Currently available price comparators can be used
for these purposes only occasionally, because they do not
provide multiple-item basket optimization.
We introduced the Internet shopping optimization
problem and provided a proof of its strong NP-hardness.
Furthermore, two polynomial time algorithms for special
cases of the ISOP were described. In the future work, we

intend to derive and experimentally test heuristic appro-
aches for the ISOP to make the suggested approach ap-
plicable for solving complex shopping cart optimization
problems in on-line applications. The ideas and algorith-
mic results given in (Musiał and Wojciechowski, 2009)
for a simplified version of the ISOP can be generalized
and extended for these purposes.
